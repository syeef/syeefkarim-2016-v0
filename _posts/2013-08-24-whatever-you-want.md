But I can feel the proof when you're holdin' me
Like to let you think you're controllin' me,
Even thought that ain't the deal,
When I want I take the wheel, and I know
Can't hide that you're really into me,
Hold is so tight I can barely breathe
'cause you know I keep it real
Giving you what you can feel
