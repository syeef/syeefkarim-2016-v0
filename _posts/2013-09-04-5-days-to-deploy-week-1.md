**Goals:** To work more with parallax and Jekyll     
**Aim:** To recreate a page similar to the <a id="links" href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/" target="_blank">Spotify homepage</a>, however I want to make it for fashion bloggers who post their photos on to Lookbook.nu     

**Day 1: Wednesday**     
Today I have established the goals and aim for this project. I have also found a couple of articles online which I feel can help me create the effect I am after. Although I haven't created a mockup of what exactly I want to create, I have a vague idea of what I would be happy with.

**Day 2: Thursday**
Today I set up the Jekyll half of the project (I say setup, however let's be real it takes about 30 seconds!)     
cd /users/[USERNAME]/Desktop     
mkdir JekyllProject     
cd /users/[USERNAME]/Desktop/JekyllProject     
mkdir \_layouts\ \_includes\ \_posts\     
touch \_config.yml\     

I've also read an article and played with an example of how someone else has created the parallax effect. I have decided to try to write the javascript by scratch as I find the examples don't really handle background images with different heights really well. Hopefully this decision won't comeback to bite me in the ass!
