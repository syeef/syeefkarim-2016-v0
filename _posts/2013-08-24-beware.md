Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back (woah)
Looking at my phone like she finna call back (woah)
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys they love
I know, I know, I know the highs, the lows 
it comes and goes; you say "be real" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everythang
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (funny right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying
