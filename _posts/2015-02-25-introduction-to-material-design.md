Material Design is a relatively new design philosiphy recenetly introduced by Google during their I/O conference.

Although new, some of its principles are related to existing design patterns, such as flat design. This is a brief presentation that I gave at Mobile Notts discussing the differences between Material Design and Flat Design as well as key tips to help Designers and Developers integrate the concept into their apps.
