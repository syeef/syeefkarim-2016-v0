**Note**  
To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential and proprietary information. The information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Capital One.

This case study is broadly broken down into smaller challenges and what my role and input was to overcome and progress forward.

**Product Goal**  
Create a mobile app to allow customers to easily service their accounts, receive relevant information regarding account health and increase overall engagement with Capital One.

**Results Achieved**  
• Shipped both an iOS and Android app within 6 months, earlier than budgetted  
• Helped foster a human centred design culture, balancing both customer and business goals  
• THIS WILL BE A THIRD POINT

>So much easier I can now control both accounts.. Love it <cite>iOS User</cite>

**My Design Process**  
• Work cloesly with partners within Product and Engineering to ensure buy in and alignment from day 1

**1. Execute an information re-architecture of the existing app**  
The existing app allowed cutomers to view their previous transactions, account balance and next payment date, but fundamentally failed to help customers make a payment and navigate the app in a meaningful way.  

Out goal was to be able to allow customers to make a payment via the app as well as update the Information Architecture to help customers easily see and browse to the content that they need.

***My Role***  
I was an interaction designer on the Capital One mobile app across iOS and Android from the start of the project in August 2014.

I led work refining and iterating features from conception through to delivery working closely with product owners and engineers.

***The Outcomes***

**2. Create an experience which respects platform norms and conventions**  

***My Role***  
• Conducted user interviews to hear first hand what customers thoughts and expectations included  
• Studied and became a subject matter expert of Material Design by Google and how through its adoption we'd be able to create a consistant experience, even across platforms  
• Gathered and analysed customer device usage statistics to get buy in and reassure Product counterparts with regards to my design decisions  

***The Outcomes***

**3. Apply an appropriate brand style for the app**

**4. Improve the accessibility of the app**  
The app was put forward for accessibility review as part of the usual Capital One quality process and had come back non-compliant, particularly with regards to colour contrast. Product counterparts were also reluctant to make any large noticeable changes to the UI with fears of causing customer confusion and uncertainty.  

***My Role***  
• Deconstructed the colours and their usage criteria within the app, looking for similar hues from the enterprise colour scheme  
• Once appropriate replacement shades were found, I compared the foreground and background colours to make sure they passed at least a WCAG 2 AA rating  
• Implemented the new coloursclosely with parners in Engineering and Quality Assurance to quickly address non-compliant colour accessibility issue, whilst minimising UI change  

***The Outcomes***  
• The app is now compliant with WGAC 2 AA rating  
• An improved process between Design, Engineering and Quality Assurance which accomodates for colour contrast and voiceover assistance  
• A rooted attitude within the product development team that a user with accessibility tools enabaled shouldn't be treated as a second class citizen
