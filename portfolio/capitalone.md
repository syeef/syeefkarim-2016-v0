**Note**  
To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential and proprietary information. The information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Capital One.

This case study is broadly broken down into smaller challenges and what my role and input was to overcome and progress forward.

**Product Goal**  
Create a mobile app to allow customers to easily service their accounts, receive relevant information regarding account health and increase overall engagement with Capital One.

**Results Achieved**  
• Shipped both an iOS and Android app within 6 months, earlier than budgetted  
• Helped foster a human centred design culture, balancing both customer and business goals  
• THIS WILL BE A THIRD POINT  

**My Design Process**  
• Work cloesly with partners within Product and Engineering to ensure buy in and alignment from day 1

**1. Execute an information re-architecture of the existing app**  
Capital One was undergoing a major transformation with regards to how projects were worked on and delivered from waterfall to agile. They had also never developed a mobile app in house before. 

***My Role***  
I was an interaction designer on the Capital One mobile app across iOS and Android from the start of the project in August 2014.

I led work refining and iterating features from conception through to delivery working closely with product owners and engineers.
