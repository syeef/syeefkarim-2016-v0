bio1: After using the bus for a while now I became frustrated that I wasn't able to easily find out when the buses were departing. Of course this problem has already been solved by others but I found their solutions either poor and outdated, or I had to pay for an app that wouldn't even guarantee full coverage! This is where getmeabus.com steps in. It simply locates you and plots all the nearby bus stops and then with either a click or tap of a bus stop display the departure times. We currently have support for the UK.
