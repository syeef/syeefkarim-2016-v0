studentdevBio: <p>I often found myself in situations where I would meet people who were really excited and motivated to play with and learn a new technology but couldn’t find any good resources to initially get started.</p> <p><a id="links" href='http://studentdev.io' target="_blank">StudentDev</a> is a small project I worked on to try to change this. It's a collection of resources to help someone learn a new technology, sharpen their design skills and even find a local meet up group.</p><p>Today it is open to anyone to contribute towards, and I'm always looking to expand the collection with newer and more relevant material.</p>

getmeabusBio: <p><a id="links" href='http://getmeabus.com' target="_blank">Get Me a Bus</a> was a project developed by <a id="links" href='http://danwilson.co' target="_blank">Danny Wilson</a> and myself. After using the bus for a while I became frustrated that I wasn't able to easily find out when the buses were departing. Of course this problem had already been solved by others but I found their solutions to be either poor and outdated, or I had to pay for an app that wouldn't even guarantee full coverage!</p> <p>This is where <a id="links" href='http://getmeabus.com' target="_blank">getmeabus.com</a> steps in. It simply locates you and plots all the nearby bus stops, then with a click of a bus stop it display the departure times. The service currently only supports the UK.</p>
