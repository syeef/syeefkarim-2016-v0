studentdevBio: <p>I often found myself in situations where I would meet people who were really excited and motivated to play with and learn a new technology but couldn’t find any good resources to initially get started.</p> <p><a id="links" href='http://studentdev.io' target="_blank">StudentDev</a> is a small project I worked on to try to change this. It's a collection of resources to help someone learn a new technology, sharpen their design skills and even find a local meet up group.</p><p>Today it is open to anyone to contribute towards, and I'm always looking to expand the collection with newer and more relevant material.</p>

mlhBio: <p>In March 2014 I started working with <a id="links" href='https://twitter.com/jna_sh' target="_blank">Joe Nash</a>, <a id="links" href='https://twitter.com/tfogo' target="_blank">Tim Fogarty</a> and <a id="links" href='http://bilaw.al' target="_blank">Bilawal Hameed</a> on a project to help build a thriving student hackathon community in the EU. <a id="links" href='https://twitter.com/SwiftAlphaOne' target="_blank">Mike Swift</a> and <a id="links" href='https://twitter.com/jonmarkgo' target="_blank">Jon Gottfried</a> were also trying to solve a similar problem in North America. A couple of phone calls, emails and deliberation sessions later, we are all now helping grow the global student hackathon community. Today <a id="links" href='https://mlh.io' target="_blank">Major League Hacking</a> helps support over 65,000 students and 200+ events and has a strong 10+ full time team behind it.</p> <p>MLH exposed me to and gave me experience working with at a startup from the earliest stages all the way through to our current huge growth. The time spent has been well worth the positive impact and growth of the student hacker community.</p>

studenthackBio: <p><a id="links" href='http://studenthack.com' target="_blank">StudentHack</a> was the first event I ever organised, and introduced me to a community I've since fallen in love with. I oversaw a fundraising campaign that raised £9,000 ($15,000) from Capital One, AutoTrader, GitHub and others for the operations of the hackathon, exceeding budgetary goals by 30%. Since the first event in February 2014, I also helped organise the October 2014 with my Co-Founder <a id="links" href='http://bilaw.al' target="_blank">Bilawal Hameed</a>.</p>

getmeabusBio: <p><a id="links" href='http://getmeabus.com' target="_blank">Get Me a Bus</a> was a project developed by <a id="links" href='http://danwilson.co' target="_blank">Danny Wilson</a> and myself. After using the bus for a while I became frustrated that I wasn't able to easily find out when the buses were departing. Of course this problem had already been solved by others but I found their solutions to be either poor and outdated, or I had to pay for an app that wouldn't even guarantee full coverage!</p> <p>This is where <a id="links" href='http://getmeabus.com' target="_blank">getmeabus.com</a> steps in. It simply locates you and plots all the nearby bus stops, then with a click of a bus stop it display the departure times. The service currently only supports the UK.</p>
