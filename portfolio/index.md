bio1: After using the bus for a while I became frustrated that I wasn't able to easily find out when the buses were departing. Of course this problem has already been solved by others but I found their solutions to be either poor and outdated, or I had to pay for an app that wouldn't even guarantee full coverage!</p> <p>This is where <a href='http://getmeabus.com'>getmeabus.com</a> steps in. It simply locates you and plots all the nearby bus stops, then with a click of a bus stop it display the departure times. We currently have support for the UK.
