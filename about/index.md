I've been to ten countries, a citizen of two, and jumped out of a plane in one, but I still wouldn't consider myself as well travelled. I can say however that I unequivocally have a passion for travelling. I can also say I have a passion for technology, particularly UI/UX. 

I live in Manchester, UK and recently graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University with a BSc in Computer Science. However, I wasn't always in Manchester. In fact I never lived in the UK until I was 12. I was raised thousands of miles away in Florida, USA.

I enjoy spending my time sketching ideas, pushing pixels in Photoshop, or prototyping in CSS & HTML. I am also part of the team behind <a id="links" href="http://www.studenthack.com/" target="_blank">StudentHack</a> and <a id="links" href="http://www.mlh.io" target="_blank">Major League Hacking UK</a>. At heart a complete adrenalin junkie, constantly looking for an excuse to try a new activity whether it be paint-balling, kayaking, white-water rafting or skydiving! I also have a minor obsession with anything related to transportation (especially airports!)

Having recently graduated, I'm currently considering my options for the forthcoming year. Although it is all new to me, with the correct can-do attitude and a genuine ambition to succeed, anything is possible.

"Every pixel counts!" It's the small details only noticed by a few that makes something ordinary that little bit more special. While trying to achieve a high attention to detail, I try to put a bit of my own personality into my work.
