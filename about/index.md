I live in Manchester, UK and study BSc Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University. However, I wasn't always in Manchester. In fact I never lived in the UK until I was 12. I was raised thousands of miles away in Florida, USA.

I enjoy spending my time sketching ideas, picking pixels in Photoshop, or smashing keys together to output some CSS & HTML. Currently I'm about to start my third year of university, but still have hopes that I might secure an internship (fingers crossed).

"Every pixel counts!" It's the small details only noticed by a few that makes something ordinary that little bit more special. While trying to achieve a high attention to detail, I try to put a bit of my own personality into my work.

Don't be shy to get your inner stalker happy. You can find out what I am tweeting about [@SyeefKarim](www.twitter.com/syeefkarim). Or if you would rather have a look from my viewpoint, feel free to view my [Instagram](www.instagram.com/syeef). And finally if you want to feel less embarrassed about the music you're listening too, check out what I just heard on [Last.fm](www.last.fm/syeef).
