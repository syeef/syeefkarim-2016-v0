I live in Manchester, UK and study BSc Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University. However, I wasn't always in Manchester. In fact I never lived in the UK until I was 12. I was raised thousands of miles away in Florida, USA.

I enjoy spending my time sketching ideas, picking pixels in Photoshop, or smashing keys together to output some CSS & HTML. Currently I'm about to start my third year of university, but still have hopes that I might secure an internship (fingers crossed).

"Every pixel counts!" It's the small details only noticed by a few that makes something ordinary that little bit more special. While trying to achieve a high attention to detail, I try to put a bit of my own personality into my work.
