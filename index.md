A lot of websites and apps feel like they've been designed and created by robots! Have we forgotten who's going to be using it? A person! I'd like to make things a bit more "human" and add a personal touch to the work that I produce. Throughout this website you'll find my thoughts & opinons as well as some of the work that I've done. Currently, I'm a product designer at Capital One where I'm responsible for their UK <a id="links" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/capital-one-uk/id481679012?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a id="links" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ie.capitalone.uk&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5pZS5jYXBpdGFsb25lLnVrIl0" target="_blank">Android</a> apps. 

I always try to be adaptive and flexible with the way I work, making room for both user and business needs. Clear communication and understanding is the cornerstone to developing a great product and it's because of this I welcome iterating, pivoting and importantly, failing.
