A lot of websites and apps feel like they've been designed and created by robots! Have we forgotten who's going to be using it? A person! I'd like to make things a bit more "human" and add a personal touch to the work that I produce. Throughout this website you'll find my thoughts & opinons as well as some of the work that I've done.

##My Process

I always try to be adaptive and flexible with the way I work, making room for both user and business needs. Clear communication and understanding is the cornerstone to developing a great product and it's because of this I welcome iteratting, pivoting and importantly, failing.
